# Cent Backend

Cent allows you to sync your NZ financial accounts to Google Sheets automatically, in the same vein as [Tiller](https://www.tillerhq.com).

Cent is developed by [Dolla](https://dolla.nz), which helps kiwis supercharge their finances.

To add the production version to your google account see [Cent on the Google Workspace Marketplace](https://workspace.google.com/marketplace/app/dolla/965094160482)

The actual google apps script application is in a separate repo: [cent](https://github.com/dolla-nz/cent)
